// In this app there is transactions coming from 3 source systems that we need to join in the data model to pull all the transaction in together. 
// The below script creates a link table between that creates keys for all combinations of Year, Period, Code and Cost Centre. 
// Note: The three tables were already loaded in above this table (with a TransactionsKey), so I am doing resident loads.
// Also not all data sources had the same field names hence some renaming e.g. CC as Cost Centre.
